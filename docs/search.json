    "text": "2.1 Summary\n\n2.1.1 The concept of remote sensing\nIn contrast to in situ or on-site observation, remote sensing is the process of gathering data about a phenomenon or object without actually coming into touch with it. The phrase is used particularly in reference to learning more about Earth and other planets.\nThe phrase “remote sensing” today typically refers to the detection and classification of Earthly objects using satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies. Based on transmitted signals, it encompasses the atmosphere, the surface, and the oceans (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It can be divided into “active” and “passive” remote sensing (where a signal is emitted to the object by a satellite or aircraft and its reflection is detected by the sensor) (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor)\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Piece of work:\nIn the first chapter, I learned how to access remote sensing data using two open source databases, Landsat and Copernicus Open Access Hub, their existence make it easy for me to access remote sensing data from anywhere in the world.\nSecondly, I learned how to use QGIS, SNAP and some packages in R for simple raster processing calculations. I used my own case and followed the instructions step by step, learning a lot about the terminology, gaining some knowledge about remote sensing and statistics and also having some questions."

    "section": "2.2 Application",
    "text": "2.2 Application\n\n2.2.1 QGIS\nWhen learning QGIS, I used as an example a map of Zhenjiang and Changzhou, two cities in Jiangsu Province, China, bordered by the Yangtze River to the north, from Copernicus Open Access Hub. Then, merged the B2 (blue), B3 (green), B4 (red) and B8 (NIR) in R10m with multiband colour, and knew the details in different enhancement options. Then, I learned about difference between R10m and R20m. Generally, upsampling is used to complement the situation when the pixel resolution is greater than the source resolution, and a common interpolation method is nearest neighbour, while downsampling is used when pixel resolution is smaller than source resolution. Here is the mechanism of nearest neighbour:\n\\(X_{src}=X_{dst}*\\frac{Width_{src}}{Width_{dst}}\\)\n\\(Y_{src}=Y_{dst}*\\frac{Height_{src}}{Height_{dst}}\\)\nIf the calculation results in a fractional number, then either remove the decimal part or round up to get the same value as the original dotted pixel. This method is very simple but inaccurate, the zoomed in image has a very bad mosaic and the zoomed out image has a very bad distortion. The problem lies in the treatment of the fractional part, which is equivalent to the process of colour gradation and cannot be fully equated with the existing colour of pixel. It is possible to use bilinear interpolation, considering the four values around the point that needs to be scaled, to see which value has more influence on it, and to give it more weight, I saw the option of bilinear interpolation then tried it. In addition, cubic has more accurate result because non-linear function can fit better but more complex.\n\n\n2.2.2 SNAP\nThe sRBG standard colour space can be used for display, network transmission and to convert colour levels on other devices into a colour space that is recognisable to the computer by means of the sRGB conversion function. This is why the brightness levels in the range [0,4095] on the Sentinel-2 can be converted to values in the range [0,255].\nWhen using SNAP, 432 nm means this wavelength is 432 nm, it is a coastal aerosol wave which wavelength is lessmthan blue wave. I like the colour composition function, which allows me to highlight different sections depending on my needs.\n\n\n\nB8-B4-B3\n\n\nHere is the scatter plot of my example:\n\n\n\nscatterplot\n\n\nIt can be seen that map of Zhenjiang and Changzhou has high brightness level, which means it is a city area, and it also shows a lot of wet bare soil, we can assume that these wet soils may be more suitable for cultivation, the overall biomass is not very large and, most notably, there is also a lot of dry bare soil lack of vegetation cover, presumably non-agricultural land.\nWhen using mask function, I got the administrative divisions of these municipalities because I downloaded the administrative divisions of China from GADM data:\n\n\n\nadministrative divisions\n\n\n(yellow: Zhenjiang, pink:Changzhou, red: Taizhou, green:Wuxi, blue: Yangzhou)\nAfter resampling and downscaling the data I got this tasselled plot, compared to the previous one I found that the downscaling had reduced the urban part, so the plot was significantly less bright, and there was more wet bare soil present than the previous one.\n\n\n\nscatterplot\n\n\nGenerally speaking, I prefer using SNAP than QGIS because it has more vivid chart and we can evaluate the local soil conditions, the size of the city and the biomass.\n\n\n2.2.3 R script\nWhen learning the code to deal with data from Landsat and Sentinel, I found a final paired t-test is performed to test whether the actual means of the urban land type from Landsat and Sentinel are equal, the degree of freedom from the results is 5970, p-value is much smaller than 0.05, which means the actual means of two groups are quite different, and at the same time, this calculation also shows the estimate mean of two samples. There are 95% probability that the true mean is between -9300.307 and -9198.368. data from Sentinel and Landsat is different."

Then, I would like to know if the image data from satellite remote sensing can be used in AI, as there are already mature deep learning algorithms with a high accuracy rate for image recognition, how to use these images to achieve functions such as automatic recognition and automatic monitoring."

In this case, the difference between radiance to reflectance and DOS correction is not significant and both can be corrected accurately. Actually, When the atmosphere is thinner or when the weather is good, the influence of the atmosphere on the ground radiation is less, the TOA and BOA are close to each other, a small part of the light reaches the sensor through the path radiance, so the less dark object needs to be substracted, the effect is close to the radiance. On the contrary, the more pixels need to be corrected the more obvious the effect of the corrected image is compared to the pre-correction image.\n# hazeDN\n\nhazeDN <- RStoolbox::estimateHaze(lsatMeta, hazeBands = 2:4, darkProp = 0.01, plot = TRUE)\n\nlsat_sref <- radCor(lsatMeta, metaData = metaData, method = \"dos\", \n                    hazeValues = hazeDN, hazeBands = 2:4)\n\nterra::writeRaster(lsat_sref, datatype=\"FLT4S\", filename = \"D:\\\\Remote Sensing\\\\week3\\\\LC08_L1TP_119038_20230104_20230111_02_T1\\\\lsat_sref.tif\", format = \"GTiff\", overwrite=TRUE)\n\n\n\nresult of hazeDN (3 Bands)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Merging imagery\nLandsat8, Landsat9 and data preparation\n# List your raster files excluding band 8 using the patter argument\nlistlandsat_8<-dir_info(\"D:\\\\Remote Sensing\\\\week3\\\\LC08_L2SP_119038_20230104_20230111_02_T1\")%>%\n  dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, \"[B123456790].TIF\")) %>%\n  dplyr::select(path)%>%\n  pull()%>%\n  as.character()%>%\n  # Load our raster layers into a stack\n  terra::rast()\n\n# List your raster files excluding band 8 using the patter argument\nlistlandsat_9<-dir_info(\n\"D:\\\\Remote Sensing\\\\week3\\\\LC08_L2SP_119038_20230104_20230111_02_T1\"\n)%>%\n  dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, \"[1B23456790].TIF\")) %>%\n  dplyr::select(path)%>%\n  pull()%>%\n  as.character()%>%\n  # Load our raster layers into a stack\n  terra::rast()\n\n# data preparation\nm1 <- terra::mosaic(listlandsat_8, listlandsat_9, fun=\"mean\")\n\n\n4.2.3 Enhancement\nCalculate the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)\nm1_NDVI <- (m1$LC08_L2SP_119038_20230104_20230111_02_T1_SR_B5 -

Until 2022, London was a sprawling metropolis, with a mix of historic and modern buildings, a well-developed transport network, and a diverse range of neighborhoods and communities.\n\nmain functional areas The city is divided into 32 boroughs, each with its own unique character and amenities. For example, the center of London is home to many of the city’s famous landmarks and tourist attractions, including Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, and the London Eye. The West End is known for its theaters, shopping, and nightlife, while the South Bank is home to many cultural institutions, including the National Theatre and the Tate Modern art museum.\n\n\n\n\nLondon borough map. Source: London Communications Agency\n\n\n\ndevelopment direction: London is surrounded by green belt land (dark green section), which serves to limit the expansion of the city and protect the surrounding countryside. Despite this, the city continues to grow, with new developments and communities being built on the outskirts of London, particularly in the east and southeast of the city. The light green section represents the areas of London that are still to be developed.\n\n\n\n\nGreen belt land surrounded London. Source: The London Plan 2021\n\n\n\ntransportation: The transport network in London is extensive and includes an underground railway system (the London Underground), a network of bus routes, and overground rail services. London is also well connected to the rest of the UK and Europe, with several major airports, including Heathrow and Gatwick, and international train services from St Pancras station.\n\nIt includes several kinds of means of transport as following: London Underground (Tube): The London Underground is a rapid transit system that operates throughout the city and is one of the oldest and largest metro systems in the world. It comprises of 11 lines and serves 270 stations.\n\nBuses: London has one of the largest urban bus networks in the world, with over 8,000 buses serving over 700 routes. Buses are an important mode of transportation for many Londoners and are a cost-effective way to travel around the city.\nOverground: London Overground is a network of suburban rail services that operates across Greater London and the surrounding areas. It connects with the London Underground and National Rail services, providing a comprehensive rail network for Londoners.\nTaxis and Private Hire Vehicles: London is famous for its black cabs, which can be hailed on the street or at taxi ranks. Private hire vehicles, also known as minicabs, must be pre-booked and are widely available throughout the city.\nCycling: London has a growing number of cycle lanes and cycle-friendly streets, and there are several schemes in place to encourage cycling, including the Santander Cycles bike hire scheme.\nWalking: London is a walkable city, and many areas are easily accessible on foot. There are also several pedestrian-only zones, making it easier and safer for people to walk around the city.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 development goals and policies in the future\n\nProvide housing for a growing population: The plan aims to deliver new homes to meet the growing demand for housing in the city.\nPromote economic growth: The plan aims to support London’s economy by creating new jobs, promoting investment, and supporting businesses. improve the efficiency and resilience.\nImprove transport and connectivity: The plan aims to make it easier for people to travel around London and connect with the rest of the country and beyond.\nEnhance the environment: The plan aims to improve the quality of the natural and built environment in London and to protect the city’s green spaces.\nPromote social inclusion and equality: The plan aims to ensure that everyone in London has the opportunity to participate in the city’s social, economic, and cultural life.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Problems during city development of London\n\nHousing Shortage: London has faced a persistent shortage of affordable housing, particularly in the central areas of the city. This has led to high levels of homelessness and housing insecurity, and has put pressure on the city’s social and healthcare systems. In addition, with the CPI and cost of living growth, it becomes more and more difficult for foreigners to live there, high rental, high energy cost, high transportation cost make them leave.\nCongestion and Traffic: London’s rapid growth has led to increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and noise pollution. The city has struggled to keep up with the demands of its growing population and has faced challenges in improving the efficiency and sustainability of its transportation network.\n\n\n\n\nAir quality focus area. Source: The London Plan 2021\n\n\n\nInadequate Infrastructure: London’s infrastructure has struggled to keep pace with the city’s growth, and there have been significant challenges in providing adequate public transportation, water and sewage services, and waste management facilities.\nEnvironmental Degradation: London’s rapid growth has led to the degradation of its natural environment, including the loss of green spaces, air and water pollution, and the degradation of its soil and vegetation.\nSocial Disparities: London is a city with significant social and economic disparities, with some areas experiencing high levels of poverty, crime, and social exclusion, while others are more affluent and economically prosperous.\nHistorical Preservation: London is a city with a rich history and cultural heritage, and there have been challenges in balancing the need to preserve its historical buildings and monuments with the demands of a modern, growing city."

This dataset is a count of surface temperatures from the summer months (June, July and August only) between 2016 and 2020, obtained from landsat8 thermal infrared imagery. In addition to the five-year average temperature for the area, the dataset also includes maximum and minimum temperatures and standard deviations to provide a visual representation of the magnitude and range of temperature changes over the five-year period in GLA.\nHigher temperatures tend to occur in densely populated areas.\n\n\n\nheat spot of London summer temperature.

The green belt around London can be seen more clearly on the map. The population of the north bank is more dense in the east than in the west. The density of population is high from the City of London all the way north, and is also high in north-east London, decreasing further east. Conversely, the centre of the South Bank is more densely populated, while the east and west are less dense. If Greater London continues to expand, the north-east and south-east would be a better choice.\nTake the City of London for example, some areas saw the highest temperatures compared with the whole city, such as Euston Station east of Regent’s Park, and most of the high heat areas were in high-traffic areas such as train stations, tube stations, shopping malls and airports.\n\n\n\nheat spot in City of London\n\n\nIn addition to population density affecting surface temperatures, industry, airport also have an impact on surface temperatures, with the highest surface temperatures occurring in the five year period shown below at the Dagenham engine plant, ocado customer fullfilment centre, ExCel International Convention and Exhibition Centre along the Thames in east London, and Heathrow Airport to the west.\n\n\n\nHighest temperature areas (east)\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest temperature areas (west)\n\n\nKnowing the temperature changes will help to understand the population distribution in GLA, which in turn will allow transport to be organised to develop faster and more accessible transport in dense areas, to develop infrastructure and to reduce the pressure on existing transport (for example, the central line passes through areas of great population density, and the central line is the oldest tube in London and still the busiest in London). The central line, for example, is the oldest and still the busiest tube in London, so it has to take on a lot of traffic pressure). In addition, more polluting facilities such as factories can be relocated to less populated areas. Knowing the distribution of temperatures can also control the creation of high temperature situations, such as the rare high temperatures in the London area in the summer of 2022.\n\n\n5.2.2 case 2: Remote sensing of motor vehicle emissions in London\nenergy hierarchy policy and target of London city plan * be lean: less energy used and energy demand management * be clean: fully use local energy (secondary energy explicit) and use energy more efficiently and cleanly. * be green: add the opportunity for using renewable energy, provide producing, storing energy on-site * be seen: monitor, verify and report on energy performance.\n\n\n\nEnergy hierarchy\n\n\nIn response to a call for collaboration between the Mayor of London and the TRUE initiative, carbon emissions from passing vehicles were tested using remote sensing technology at nine sites across Greater London between 2017 and 2018, with carbon emissions data recorded for over 100,000 vehicles, The experiment focused on petrol and diesel vehicles in the London area, with vehicle types including passenger cars, buses, light passenger vehicles, trucks and motorbikes, and measured emissions of carbon oxides and nitrogen oxides.\nThe remote sensing equipment used for the experiments was the Opus AccuScan RSD5000, which was the first to test exhaust gases in three main ways:\n\nThe device emits infrared and ultraviolet light velocities that pass through vehicle emissions, measuring the attenuation of these beams, instant vehicle emissions, the device measures nitrogen oxides and carbon oxides, opacity is measured as a proxy for respirable particulate matter, the device emits a frequency of 200 Hz and can measure 100 times in 0.5 seconds.\nMeasurement of the instantaneous acceleration of the vehicle as a measure of the engine load, which is related to the instantaneous emission rate.\nOne camera is responsible for photographing the vehicle licence plate for database comparison to determine its model, displacement standard.\n\nThe general conditions of testing vehicles\n\n\n\nCharacteristic of testing vehicles\n\n\nResult:\n\nDiesel passenger cars are six to seven times more likely to emit nitrogen oxides than petrol passenger cars.\n\n\n\n\n6 standard Euro NOx emission. Source: Dallmann et al., 2018\n\n\n\nEuro5 and Euro6 diesel engines emit significantly more nitrogen oxides than Euro3 and Euro4, while petrol engines emit the similar amount\n\n\n\n\naverage distance NOx emission for different vehicle family. Source: Dallmann et al., 2018\n\n\nTherefore, petrol vehicles outperform diesel vehicles and to achieve carbon emission reductions, the number of diesel vehicles needs to be limited and Euro3 or Euro4 diesel engines should be promoted instead of Euro5 and Euro6."

Then, use a kind of remote sensing equipment to measure the carbon emission of different vehicles, and come up with some constructive advice to acheive lower carbon target."
